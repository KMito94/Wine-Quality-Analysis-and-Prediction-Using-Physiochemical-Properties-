# Wine-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Physiochemical-Properties-
Problem Statement 
Quality control is a critical aspect of any manufacturing process. Wine producers need to understand which chemical properties most strongly influence wine quality in order to improve production and maintain consistency. This project analyses physicochemical wine data to identify key drivers of quality and build predictive models.
Objectives 
i.	Explore and understand wine chemical properties
ii.	Identify factors that influence wine quality
iii.	Build predictive models to classify wine quality
iv.	Translate findings into actionable insights
Data Description 
a.	Observations: Individual wine samples
b.	Features: Acidity, sugar, sulfur compounds, alcohol, density, pH, sulphates 
c.	Target Variables: Quality score (ordinal)
d.	ID: Unique identifier (Excluded from modelling)
Tools & Technologies 
•	Python
•	Pandas & NumPy 
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn
•	Jupyter Notebook
Methodology
1.	Data loading and validation
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.	Outlier and distribution analysis
4.	Correlation and feature relationship analysis
5.	Feature scaling and preparation
6.	Machine learning modeling
7.	Model evaluation and interpretation 
Key Insights 
•	Wine quality distribution is imbalanced, dominated by average-quality wines
•	Alcohol content has the strongest positive impact on wine quality
•	Volatile acidity negatively affects wine quality
•	Sulphates contribute positively but moderately 
•	Density is negatively correlated with quality 
Modeling Results 
1.	Logistic Regression: Provided a strong baseline with interpretable coefficients
2.	Random Forest: Achieved higher predictive performance
3.	Feature importance aligned with EDA findings, validating analysis consistency 
Business Recommendations
•	Focus on optimizing alcohol levels during fermentation
•	Control volatile acidity to avoid quality degradation
•	Monitor sulphate levels for stability and state balance
•	Use predictive models for early quality screening 
Portfolio Summary
This project demonstrates the full data analysis lifecycle: from raw data exploration to machine learning and business insight generation.
